# ISE-Automations
Cisco ISE Automations Using the ERS API

This library is still a work in progress, but will eventual contain the most common <br>
ISE automations that have been requested by customers while implementing ISE for them.


Currently Planned Automations:
-----------------------------
Network Device Add and Removal <br>
MAB Database Device Add and Removal


I have included the ISE ERS API User Guide for anyone wanting to modify these scripts.
